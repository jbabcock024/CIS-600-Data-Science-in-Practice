# Objective - Understand and (visually) identify the distribution and patterns
#             of network protocols over time.
# Task type - DV with supporting DQ
# Implementation - Uses data table aggregation to summarize protocol usage by
#                 hour, then use ggplot to create a visualization.
# Results - Protocol distribution is relatively flat until Nov 1st (DOS attack
#           day), where UDP, TCP, and ICMP protocols spike. ARP remains flat.
# Comments - Log scale used to better visualize protocols with different volumes.

# Results - Unclear results from visualization.
# Comments - 
# For UDP:
# - Many IoT devices use UDP for discovery protocols (like SSDP on port 1900)
# - Broadcast/multicast messages often have null or empty destination ports
# - DNS queries, DHCP, and other common IoT protocols use UDP
# - The high number of unknown destination ports in UDP traffic is
#   likely due to response packets or broadcast traffic
# For TCP:
# - The high number of unknown ports could be from:
# -- Dynamic port allocation for IoT device connections
# -- Connection attempts that didn't complete
# -- Port scanning (especially on 11/1 DOS and 11/2 Brute Force & Spoofing)

# Results - Significant concentration of connections on Nov 1st (DOS day).
# Comments - Log scale needed as the number of connections on Nov 1st would
#            otherwise overshadow the rest of the days/times.
