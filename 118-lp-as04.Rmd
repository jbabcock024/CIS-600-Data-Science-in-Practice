# 2023-10-30  Monday    - Recon
# 2023-10-31  Tuesday   - Benign 1
# 2023-11-01  Wednesday - DoS
# 2023-11-02  Thursday  - Brute Force and Spoofing
# 2023-11-03  Friday    - Benign 2

#   Task 1 - Traffic Rate Analysis
# 
#   Objective
#   - The objective is to characterize network traffic patterns during normal
#     operations versus attack periods
#     
#   Type of task
#   - Hybrid approach
#     - Database Queries for rate calculations
#     - Data Visualization for pattern analysis
# 
#   Implementation
#   - Use time-series analysis with hourly aggregation to calculate traffic rates
#   - Separate data into benign and attack periods for comparison
# 
#   Results
#   - Generated time-series plots that show bytes/s for ICMP, TCP, and UDP
# 
#   Assessment
#   - Benign traffic is mostly TCP
#   - Malicious traffic is mostly UDP, but TCP is also a significant amount
#     - The next step would be to find away to distinguish between benign and
#       malicious TCP traffic

#   Task 2 - Network Flow Size Analysis
# 
#   Objective
#   - The objective is to analyze and characterize the size distribution of
#     network flows across different protocols and identify potential anomalies
#     
#   Type of task
#   - Hybrid approach
#     - Database Queries for statistical calculations
#     - Data Visualization for distribution analysis
# 
#   Implementation
#   - Use boxplots to visualize flow size distributions by protocol
#   - Handle extreme outliers by focusing on 99th percentile and below
#   - Implement log scaling for better visibility of distributions
# 
#   Results
#   - Generated boxplots showing flow size distributions separated by:
#     - Protocol (ICMP, TCP, UDP)
#     - Date (attack vs benign days)
#   - Summary of flow statistics
# 
#   Assessment
#   - UDP flows show the most variation in size
#   - TCP flows are generally smaller but more inconsistent in size and number of outliers
#   - ICMP flows are very similar to each other
#   - Attack days show different distribution patterns compared to benign days
#     - Further analysis needed to characterize these differences

#   Task 3 - Source-Destination Pair Analysis
# 
#   Objective
#   - The objective is to analyze communication patterns between internal and
#     external network entities to identify potential security concerns
#     
#   Type of task
#   - Hybrid approach
#     - Database Queries for relationship analysis
#     - Data Visualization for pattern detection
# 
#   Implementation
#   - Analyze source-destination relationships
#   - Calculate flow statistics for different communication types
#   - Visualize proportional traffic distribution
# 
#   Results
#   - Generated stacked bar chart showing traffic distribution patterns
#   - Summary of flow statistics
# 
#   Assessment
#   - Benign days consist mostly of internal-internal and internal-external traffic
#   - Days 1 and 3 (attack) are dominated by one type of traffic, while day 4 
#     (attack) mimics days 2 and 5 (benign)

#   Drawing Conclusion
#   
#   Import
#   - tidyverse
#   - ggplot2 for visualizations
#   - data.table for vectorized operations (faster with large datasets)
#   - vroom for faster reading of CSV files
#   - custom dataset made from packet captures
#   
#   Tidy
#   - perform analyses to understand structure of dataset
#   - do research to understand why the structure may be the way it is
#     - for example, discovery using UDP often has unknown destination ports, so
#       these entries shouldn't be removed despite looking incorrect
#   - clean data (drop entries with dates outside of the expected range)
#
#   Understand Loop
#   - Transform
#     - Add data types and additional features like rates (bytes per hour)
#   - Visualize
#     - As done in LP AS03/04
#   - Model
#     - TBC (Machine Learning with Python: Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost)
#
#   Communicate
#   - Summarize and explain implementations, outputs, and future work
